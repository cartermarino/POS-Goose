POS STORIES

Necessary for MVP:

As a customer, I want to see a virtual menu (list of food items with prices) so I can choose my meal (the food order) at the restaurant.

As a customer, I want to be able to add the items of my food order to a receipt.

As a customer or restaurant staff, I want to update the order so that either person can see/display the total cost (include tax) across all changes in the order.

As a cashier, I want to switch between orders so I can serve multiple tables.

As a customer/restaurant staff member, I want to have a nice virtual menu that makes it easy to manage orders.
